Hello. You've found the voice of the Software Engineers working within the UK Tote Group Engineering department.

In this blog, members of our Engineering department discuss some of the technical challenges they've encountered in their work, share useful techniques from across our Engineering Guilds, or give insights and opinions on the world of Software development, testing, automation and DevOps.

To give some context, a cross-section of the strategic technologies we use day-to-day in the team are:
- .NET Core (c#)
- React
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Docker
- Kubernetes

In addition to these we also make use of a number of complementary 3rd party tools and SaaS products including GitHub, CircleCI, LaunchDarkly, Sentry, Contentful, PowerBI and many more.

We host our apps in AWS, where we make use of services such as EKS, SNS, S3, GraphQL, CloudWatch and more to deliver highly performant, scalable and robust services to UK Tote customers.
